Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper constitutes an attempt to summarize the most important facts
 and information on the topic of analog, modular synthesizers.
 The range of discussed subjects involves a series of various perspectives,
 including historical, theoretical, electronic and practical viewpoints.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Its goal is to convey an understanding of the inner workings of electronic
 synthesizers and their components.
 Moreover the reader is guided through the process of creating a small but
 functional modular synthesizer setup that is fun to play and experiment
 with.
 The intention was to investigate the possibilities and limits in designing
 and building an analog sound device for someone, who had not been in contact
 with analog synthesizers, let alone building electronics devices before.
 The project was inspired by the film

\begin_layout Section*
Chapter Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first chapter represents the research on the historical background of
 analog synthesizers since the beginning of the twentieth century.
 It was tried to outline important milestones in the historic development
 from the first electronic sound generating devices until a point in time
 when manufacturers of modular synthesizers have developed a profitable
 market.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Subsequently the most important concepts of subtractive synthesis are summarized.
 A general overview over common sound generation and processing methods
 is given, whereby all concepts are applicable to both analog and digital
 synthesis.
 In chapter three these concepts are taken one step further and discussed
 in the context of electronic circuitry.
 Lastly the process of building an electronic synthesizer prototype is described.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The process of building the prototype includes working with an oscilloscope
 to examine and verify the shape of various waveforms before and after modulatio
n.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
To make it playable with a keyboard, a MIDI input module is added.
 It features an Arduino microprocessor to convert digital MIDI messages
 into control voltage outputs that other modules can connect to.
 It is the only digital component of the synthesizer, while tone generation
 and processing are analog.

.
 Working against incredible technical difficulties, he succeeded to create
 an electrical sound generator, that produced alternating sine wave shaped
 currents of different audio frequencies.
 A modified electrical dynamo was used in conjunction with several specially
 geared shafts and inductors to create the signals.
 The Dynamophone could be played with a polyphonic keyboard and featured
 special acoustic horns to convert the electrical vibrations into sound

In 1924 the russian inventor Leon Theremin created the Aetherophone, which
 would later be known as the Theremin.
 Unlike most electric instrument developed around that time, the Theremin
 had no keyboard.
 It was played merely by hand motion around two capacitive detecors, that
 generated electrical fields.
 These were affected by the electric capacity of the human body.
 One of these detectors was a vertical rod to control dynamics and the other
 a horizontal loop to change the pitch

Some organ-like precursors to the synthesizer were the Ondes Martenot and
 the Trautonium, which were devised just a few years later.
 The Ondes Martenot is one of the few early electric instruments, that are

The Givelet (1929) was a commercially more successful instrument, since
 it was designed as a cheap alternative to pipe organs.
 These instruments were polyphonic and unified the concepts of the Pianola
 - a self-playing piano, controlled by pre-punched tape - with electronic
 sound genaration.
 The ability to program electronic sounds should lead the way for future
 devices such as the RCA synthesizer or computer music production in general.
 However, the Givelet was about to take a back seat, when Laurens Hammond
 published his Hammond Organ in 1935.
 Its technical operation principle is reminiscent of the Dynamophone, since
 it also involved rotating discs in a magnetic field

The german engineer Harald Bode contributed to the design of several new
 instruments from the 1930's on, like the warbo formant organ (1937) or
 later the Melochord (1949).
 He was primarily interested in providing tools for a wide range of musicians,
 which is why his contributions straddled between the two major design tradition
s of new sounds versus imitation of traditional ones.
 He turned out to be one of central figures in the history of electronic
 music, since he was also one of the primary engineers in establishing the
 classic tape music studio in europe

The First Synthesizers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 1955 the laboratories of the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) introduced
 a new and very advanced machine to the public named the Olson-Belar Sound
 Synthesizer, later known as the RCA Mark I Music Synthesizer.
 It combined many means of tone generation and sound modification known
 at the time and is considered the first synthesizer.
 Mark I was built with the specific intention of imitating traditional instrumen
t sounds and to reduce the costs of the production of popular music by replacing
 musicians.
 However, the machine proved unsuitable for its original intent and was
 later used completely for electronic music experimentation and composition

 The synthesizer could not be played in the conventional sense in real time.
 Instead musical information had to be pre programmed as punched holes in
 a large paper tape.
 Harry Olson and Herbert Belar produced an improved Mark II Synthesizer

Around the same time the outstanding guitarist and inventor Les Paul became
 famous with his multitrack guitar recordings.
 He stimulated many innovators not only with the success of his multitrack
 recorder, but also with his methods of electronic sound processing.
 Harald Bode was so impressed and inspired by his work, that he built a
 system consisting of a number of electronic modules for sound modification
 in late 1959 through 1960.
 His system featured ring modulator devices, envelope followers and generators,
 voltage-controlled amplifiers, filters, mixers and others

 Similar developments had been taking place at the west coast of the united

 Morton Subotnick and Ramon Sender started their carreer in electronic music
 experimentation and became increasingly dissatisfied with the severe limitation
s of traditional equipment at the San Francisco Tape Music Center.
 They sought out to hire a competent engineer and met Donald Buchla

 Buchla's design approach differed significantly from Moog.
 He rejected the idea of a synthesizing familiar sounds and resisted the

 It seemed much more interesting to emphasize new timbral possibilities
 and stress the complexity that could arise from randomness.

Theory of Subtractive Synthesis

 The subtractive synthesis however, appears to be the most common one.
 But how can these sounds actually be synthesized? This question will be
 examined in the following.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Sources
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Acoustic events can generally be divided in two groups: noises and tones.
 Whereas tones - as opposed to noise - are classified as sound waves, that
 oscillate in a periodic manner.
 However this is only a theoretical classification, since most natural sounds
 are a combination of the two

\begin_layout Subsection
Wave Oscillation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the root of every artificial tone generating system there is an element
 that produces an oscillation.
 This element is mostly described as the oscillator, which represents the
 very source of what can be heard eventually.
 The oscillator produces a periodic wave, that moves between an amplitude-minima
 and -maxima.
 Its waveform (shape of the wave) determines the overtone structure and
 therefore the timbre of this basic source sound.
 Oscillators often provide several waveforms between which it is possible
 to switch back and forth.
 The pitch of the output signal is defined by the frequency of the wave
 and must oscillate between 20Hz and 20kHz in order for it to be audible
 to humans 
\begin_inset ERT

cite[p.~124]{Friesecke2007}
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The output signal can later be processed and modulated in several ways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oscillators that swing at an infrasonic frequency - meaning a frequency
 so low, that it is not hearable anymore - are called low frequency oscillators
 (LFO).
 They are used to control parameters of different components of the synthesizer
 periodically.
 For example to influence the pitch of another oscillator to get a vibrato
 - or the amplitude to get a tremolo effect.
 Some oscillators frequencies range from very low to very high, in which
 case a distinction between oscillator and LFO is unnecessary.

 A true square wave has a 50 % duty cycle - equal high and low periods.
 However, oscillators often feature a pulse width parameter, trough which
 the high-low time ratio can be accessed.
 This has a distinct influence on the wave's timbre.
 In this case, the square becomes a pulse waveform.

Triggering Notes

\begin_layout Standard
In order to use the previously discussed signal generators in a musical
 context, it is necessary to cut off their stationary signals when no note
 is being played.
 This is accomplished by routing the output signal of the generator to an
 amplifier and providing it with a gate signal.
 The source of the gate signal can be a keyboard or a sequencer, which would
 also send a pitch value to the oscillator to set its frequency

Dynamic Envelopes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most important component responsible for shaping the dynamic structure
 of a note is the envelope.
 It is triggered by the the gate on/off signal and outputs a control signal
 that fades between the different state phases of a note.
 The rapidity of these changes is adjusted by parameters, that represent
 these states.
 Its output signal can be used to control an amplifier and therefore shape
 the dynamic structure of the note.
 The most common envelope type is the ADSR, which stands for attack, decay,
 sustain, release.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
Attack sets how long the envelope signal rises after a note was triggered

 They remove a spectrum of frequencies from their input signal above or
 below the cutoff frequency and are often used in conjunction with an envelope
 or LFO modulation on the cutoff.
 This cutoff frequency is an important parameter determining the frequency
 at which the signal begins to be attenuated.
 The slew rate sets the slope of the filter - meaning how abrubt frequencies
 are being cut.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Filters can generally be devided into two categories: Low pass and high
 pass filters (also called high cut and low cut).
 To get a bandpass filter, low- and high pass are connected in series.
 When connected parallely, they become a bandstop or bandreject filter.
 Lastly the allpass filter should be mentioned, which does not change the
 frequency spectrum but merely influences the phase of the signal around
 its cutoff

Natural Resonance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most basic form of an oscillator circuit producing a sawtooth signal
 can be realized with just a few parts.
 A current charges a capacitor at a certain rate.
 Between the electrodes of the capacitor a voltage potential rises.
 The voltage is constantly compared with a reference voltage by a detector
 (Schmitt trigger).
 Once it reaches the predefined threshold, an electronic switch (transistor)
 is activated.
 This switch short-circuits the capacitor and discharges it, causing the
 output voltage to drop back to its initial potential.
 This is happening continiously, wheras the rate of the repetition determines
 the frequency of the generated signal.

 The sine wave is an exception, because there is no simple electronic method

 What is generally used is a rounded triangle, which gives at least 1 %
 of harmonic distortion.
 In order to get a purer sine wave, the harmonics can be filtered out with

 The voltage to pitch distribution curve of an oscillator is determined
 by its exponential response to the voltage at its CV input.
 In a volt per octave system an increase by 1 volt at the input must result
 in a doubling of the oscillation frequency at the output.
 Thus octave purity is achieved.

Filter circuits are generally based upon the fact that the transfer of alternati

 A signal simply passed through a capacitor resembles a high pass filter.
 If the capacitor is connected to the ground the high frequencies are short
 circuited and low frequencies remain in the signal path.
 This is referred to as a resistor-capacitor (RC) element.
 This simple circuit represents a passive, first-order butterworth filter
 with a roll-off of 6 dB per octave.

 However, as their flexibility and capabilities increase (e.g.

 circuits tend to get exceedingly complex, requiring solid expertise in
 electronics.

This is why it was decided to switch to the usage of pre-designed, professionall

 all the circuits on perf boards as originally intended.
 This made the goal of intermodular controllability attainable more easyily.
 The downside of this approach are higher costs for boards and parts.
 However, the quality of the end-product is impressing.
 Also the time saving using this strategy is not to be underestimated.

 For example Doepfer's modules are only compatible with their EuroRack cases,
 with a height of 128.5mm.
 These EuroRack modules use jack connectors for patching.
 A different size format often used in the DIY modular synth scene is the
 one the serge synthesizers use.
 They use banana jack connectors instead of mini jack for patching, which
 have the possibility of stacking banana connectors on top of each other
 and splitting the signal without having to use a multiplier module.
 For this project a combination was chosen: The modules are EuroRack size,

 Instead of the 7815 and 7915 voltage regulator ICs the 7812 and 7912 were

 The modules can be connected to the four male 16-pin flat ribbon connectors,
 that were added to make the power supply compliant to the EuroRack standard.
 Another possibility would be to make a flying bus board by attaching those
 connectors to a flat ribbon cable that lies in the case.
 Or even just fix female connectors to the cable and plug them directly
 into the modules.
 Additionally it is planned to add an IEC socket and a power switch to it
 for more comfortable on and off switching and more steady starting current.

 It is cut and placed face down onto the upper side of the panel.
 By thoroughly pressing down a hot flat iron (for ironing clothes) onto
 the panel for a few minutes, the toner cartridge particles move to the

 The paper residues need to be removed by placing the panel in some water

 Afterwards the panel is sealed with transparent lacquer.
 Once the panel is dried, the holes for the knobs, switches, etc.

 and is based upon the principle of the Sallen and Key filter (see chapter
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
 It combines two linkable filter stages in one module.
 Each stage features cutoff and frequency knobs, as well as several voltage
 control inputs for cutoff frequency and resonance, whereas the cutoff frequency
 input can be attenuated and inverted with one knob representing modulation
 depth (labeled: ×-1 ...
 0 ...
 ×1).
 The HP/LP switch determines, if the filter is used in high pass or low
 pass mode.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When turning resonance up, at one point the filter begins to self-resonate
 at the given cutoff frequency, which means that the filter can also be
 utilized as an oscillator.
 Therefore a volt per octave input for the cutoff control voltage was added,
 to be able to control the oscillating frequency in a musical context.
 A look at the oscilloscope shows a sine like waveform with few overtones.
 Turning the resonance to the maximum, the filter goes into distortion and
 the wave becomes more square causing the sound to get more rough.
 The amount of distortion is visually represented by a red LED.

The objective to create a functional prototype can be considered a complete
 success.
 The synthesizer that was built is a lot of fun to experiment with, which
 was one of the initial goals also.
 Even though it is practically just a self oscillating filter, it offers
 a lot of possibilities for experimental sound design.
 Due to the fact that the banana plugs are stackable, the two output signals
 can be split several times to voltage control resonance and cutoff of each
 filter stage.
 Also various types of feedback can be generated.

\begin_layout Standard
This project provides a great basis for further sound experimentation.
 Because of its modular setup, there is lots of space for further modules,
 although the requirements for power supply and case size will increase
 with the number of modules.
 Next up the construction of an oscillator module is planned as soon as
 time and monetary means allow it.

A Personal Journey
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a trained programmer and web application developer the field of electronic
 engineering always seemed appealing to me.
 Hence the assignment for a research paper during the audio engineering
 course at SAE Institute seemed like a welcome opportunity to dive into
 the realm of building electronic devices in the context of sound generation
 and modification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The process of writing this paper has been an unexpectedly rewarding and
 inspiring experience, pushing the boundaries of my own musical and technical
 understanding.
 Most notably the concepts of free composition - meaning allowing randomness
 and therefore putting oneself in the position of reacting to a musical
 system, influencing it in terms of tendencies, rather than controlling
 it with a predetermed mindset - has been something that really changed
 my perseption of musical creativity.
 This for me seems much more attainable in the analog world, where electrical
 components and signal chains can be brought to their tipping points, resulting
 in an unpredictable outcome.
 That is where sound exploration begins, which is a totally different experience
 than knowing what will happen.
 Virtual digital environments, which I was familiar with on the other hand,
 generally seem to tend persuade the user to feel in control at all times.

Acknowledgment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At first I want to thank Fabian Gawlick and Sebastian Metzner for introducing
 me to the topics of electronical engineering and sound synthesis.
 I would like to thank Edmund Heineke Jaek for teaching me a lot about amplifica
tion and helping me with the power supply for the prototype.
 I am very grateful to Diego, Jano and Victor from befaco for their awesome
 workshop and for helping me with a lot of tips and literature on the discussed
 topics.
 A big thank you goes out to Derek Holzer, who gave me an extended introduction
 into his self constructed modular system and shared some valuable sound
 design concepts.
 Also I want to thank Richard Pannek, David Markwart, Roosa Hämäläinnen
 and Vicki Schmatolla for proof reading and their feedback on this paper.
 Lastly I want to thank SAE institute for making this project possible.
