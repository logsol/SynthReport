Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper constitutes an attempt to summarize the most important facts
 and information on the topic of analog, modular synthesizers.
 The range of discussed subjects involves a series of various perspectives,
 including historical, theoretical, electronic and practical viewpoints.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Its goal is to convey an understanding of the inner workings of electronic
 synthesizers and their components.
 Moreover the reader is guided through the process of creating a small but
 functional modular synthesizer setup that is fun to play and experiment
 with.
 The intention was to investigate the possibilities and limits in designing
 and building an analog sound device for someone who had not been in contact
 with analog synthesizers before, let alone building electronics devices.
 The project was inspired by the film

Chapter Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The chapter 
\emph on
Historic Evolution of the Synthesizer
\emph default
 represents the research on the historical background of analog synthesizers
 since the beginning of the twentieth century.
 It was tried to outline important milestones in the historic development
 from the first electronic sound generating devices until a point in time
 when manufacturers of modular synthesizers have developed a profitable
 market.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Subsequently the most important concepts of subtractive synthesis are summarized.
 A general overview over common sound generation and processing methods
 is given, whereby all concepts are applicable to both analog and digital
 synthesis.
 In chapter three these concepts are taken one step further and discussed
 in the context of electronic circuitry.
 Lastly the process of building an electronic synthesizer prototype is described.

 Working against incredible technical difficulties he succeeded to create
 an electrical sound generator with a weight of around 200 metric tons.
 It produced alternating sine wave shaped currents of different audio frequencie
s.
 A modified electrical dynamo was used in conjunction with several specially
 geared shafts and inductors to create the signals.
 The Dynamophone could be played with a polyphonic keyboard and featured
 special acoustic horns to convert the electrical vibrations into sound

), which would later be known as the Theremin.
 Unlike most electric instrument developed around that time, the Theremin
 had no keyboard.
 It was played merely by hand motion around two capacitive detecors, that
 generated electrical fields.
 These were affected by the electric capacity of the human body.
 One of these detectors was a vertical rod to control dynamics and the other
 a horizontal loop to change the pitch

The Givelet (1929) was a commercially more successful instrument, since
 it was designed as a cheap alternative to pipe organs.
 These instruments were polyphonic and unified the concepts of the Pianola
 - a self-playing piano, controlled by pre-punched tape - with electronic
 sound genaration.
 The ability to program electronic sounds should lead the way for future
 devices such as the RCA synthesizer or computer music production in general.
 However, the Givelet was about to take a back seat, when Laurens Hammond
 published his Hammond Organ in 1935.
 Its technical operation principle is reminiscent of the Dynamophone, since
 it also involved rotating discs in a magnetic field

 He was primarily interested in providing tools for a wide range of musicians,
 which is why his contributions straddled between the two major design tradition
s of new sounds versus imitation of traditional ones.
 He turned out to be one of the central figures in the history of electronic
 music, since he was also one of the primary technicians in establishing
 the classic tape music studio in Europe

The First Synthesizers

\begin_layout Standard
In 1955 the laboratories of the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) introduced
 a new and very advanced machine to the public named the Olson-Belar Sound
 Synthesizer, later known as the RCA Mark I Music Synthesizer.
 It combined many means of tone generation and sound modification known
 at the time and is considered the first synthesizer.
 Mark I was built with the specific intention of imitating traditional instrumen
t sounds and to reduce the costs of the production of popular music by replacing
 musicians.
 However, the machine proved unsuitable for its original intent and was
 later used completely for electronic music experimentation and composition

 The synthesizer could not be played in the conventional sense in real time.
 Instead musical information had to be pre programmed as punched holes in
 a large paper tape.
 Harry Olson and Herbert Belar produced an improved Mark II Synthesizer
 in 1957, which the nickname

 was given.

Around the same time the outstanding guitarist and inventor Les Paul became
 famous with his multitrack guitar recordings.
 He stimulated many innovators not only with the success of his multitrack
 recorder, but also with his methods of electronic sound processing.
 Harald Bode was so impressed and inspired by his work, that he built a
 system consisting of a number of electronic modules for sound modification
 in late 1959 through 1960.
 His system featured ring modulator devices, envelope followers and generators,
 voltage-controlled amplifiers, filters and other

 Similar developments had been taking place at the west coast of the united
 states.
 Morton Subotnick and Ramon Sender started their career in electronic music
 experimentation and became increasingly dissatisfied with the severe limitation
s of traditional equipment at the San Francisco Tape Music Center.
 They sought out to hire a competent engineer and met Donald Buchla (see

 Their discussions resulted in the concept of a modular voltage-controlled
 system.
 Buchla's design approach differed significantly from Moog.
 He rejected the idea of a synthesizing familiar sounds and resisted the
 word

 To him it seemed much more interesting to emphasize new timbral possibilities
 and stress the complexity that could arise from randomness.
 At the same time Buchla was fascinated with designing control devices other
 than the standard keyboard, which Moog decided to use for playing

Theory of Subtractive Synthesis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the last century different kinds of synthesis methods have emerged.
 The subtractive synthesis however, appears to be the most common one.
 It is a method of sound synthesis, where partials of the initially generated
 signal are attenuated with a filter to change the timbre of the sound.
 But how can these sounds actually be synthesized? And what exactly does
 a filter do? These questions will be examined in the following.

Acoustic events can generally be divided in two groups: noises and tones.
 Whereas tones - as opposed to noise - are classified as sound waves, that

At the root of every artificial tone generating system there is an element
 that produces an oscillation.
 This element is mostly described as the oscillator, which represents the
 very source of what can be heard eventually.
 The oscillator produces a wave, that moves between an amplitude-minima
 and -maxima.
 Its waveform (shape of the wave) determines the overtone structure and
 therefore the timbre of this basic source sound.
 Oscillators often provide several waveforms between which it is possible
 to switch back and forth (see figure 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ref{fig-waves}

\end_inset

).
 The pitch of the output signal is defined by the frequency of the wave
 and must oscillate between 20 Hz and 20 kHz in order for it to be audible
 to humans

 The output signal can later be processed and modulated in several ways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oscillators that swing at an infrasonic frequency - meaning a frequency
 so low, that it is not hearable anymore - are called low frequency oscillators
 (LFO).
 They are used to control parameters of different components of the synthesizer
 periodically.
 For example to influence the pitch of another oscillator to get a vibrato
 - or the amplitude to get a tremolo effect.
 Some oscillators frequencies range from very low to very high, in which
 case a distinction between oscillator and LFO is unnecessary.

 A true square wave has a 50 % duty cycle - equal high and low periods.
 However, oscillators often feature a pulse width parameter, trough which
 the high-low time ratio can be accessed.
 This has a distinct influence on the wave's timbre.
 In this case, the square becomes a pulse waveform.

Triggering Notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to use the previously discussed signal generators in a musical
 context, it is necessary to cut off their stationary signals when no note
 is being played.
 This is accomplished by routing the output signal of the generator to an
 amplifier and providing it with a gate signal.
 The source of the gate signal can be a keyboard or a sequencer, which would
 also send a pitch value to the oscillator to set its frequency

 To get a more interesting sound, the signal can be manipulated in acoustic
 color or dynamics by one or more processing units.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Dynamic Envelopes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most important component responsible for shaping the dynamic structure
 of a note is the envelope.
 It is triggered by the gate on/off signal and outputs a control signal
 that fades between the different state phases of a note.
 The rapidity of these changes is adjusted by parameters, that represent
 these states.
 Its output signal can be used to control an amplifier and therefore shape
 the dynamic structure of the note.
 The most common envelope type is the ADSR, which stands for attack, decay,
 sustain, release.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
Attack Sets how long the envelope signal rises after a note was triggered
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
Decay Sets how long it takes for the envelope signal to drop from its maximum
 to the sustain level after the attack phase was completed
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
Sustain Sets the output level for the time period after the decay phase
 and before the gate signal was terminated
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
Release Sets the length of the fade out after the note has ended
\end_layout

 They remove a spectrum of frequencies from their input signal above or
 below the cutoff frequency and are often used in conjunction with an envelope
 or LFO modulation on the cutoff.
 This cutoff frequency is an important parameter determining the frequency
 at which the signal begins to be attenuated.
 The slope of the filter determines how abrupt frequencies are being cut.
 Another common parameter is called resonance.
 It controls the level of a feedback loop, emphasizing the timbre at the
 cutoff frequency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Filters can generally be divided into two categories: Low pass and high
 pass (also called high cut and low cut).
 To get a band pass, low- and high pass are connected in series.
 When connected in parallel, they become a band stop or band reject filter.
 Lastly the all pass filter should be mentioned, which does not change the
 frequency spectrum but merely influences the phase of the signal around
 its cutoff

 A keyboard for example is a manual controller, since it is the movement

 and then used to control pitch and amplitude of a note.

\begin_layout Standard
A modular synthesizer is an instrument, where sound generators, processors
 and control facilities are presented in separate independent entities called
 modules.
 These modules are not wired in a preconceived way, but are connected with
 patch chords.
 The second essential aspect is the concept of inter-modular controllability,
 with which modules may modulate or regulate other modules.

\begin_layout Section
General
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In digital synthesis audio signals and control signals are often being different
iated.
 This is because computing power can be saved by limiting the sample rate
 for control signals, since they usually only require a fraction of the
 amount of sampling values to get acceptable results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the area of analog modular synthesis it is important to know that signals
 are nothing but alternating and/or direct currents usually with voltages
 ranging from -5 to +5 volts.
 That is why there is no difference between audio and control signals.
 This has a great impact on the extend of possibilities especially in modular
 systems.
 One of the consequences is that an oscillator can control the frequency
 of a second oscillator with its output signal.
 This is known as frequency-modulation or FM synthesis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, when combining or mixing control and audio signals one should be
 aware of the following phrase, stated by Donald Buchla:

DC offset doesn't make any difference in the sound domain but it makes a
 big difference in the structural domain, whereas harmonic distortion makes
 very little difference in the control area but it can be very significant

In a modular synthesizer setup, all sound generating and processing modules
 are aggregated and connected to a central power supply with a common ground.
 Among the modular components the signals are transferred via patch chords.
 The modules should be engineered to have the lowest possible output impedance
 and a relatively high input impedance.
 A common impedance ratio is 1:100.

).
 A current charges a capacitor at a certain rate.
 Between the electrodes of the capacitor a voltage potential rises.
 Meanwhile the voltage is constantly compared with a reference voltage by
 a detector (Schmitt trigger).
 Once it reaches the predefined threshold, an electronic switch (transistor)
 is activated.
 This switch short-circuits the capacitor and discharges it, causing the
 output voltage to drop back to its initial potential.
 This is happening continuously, whereas the rate of the repetition determines
 the frequency of the generated signal.

 The sine wave is an exception, because there is no simple electronic method

 What is generally used is a rounded triangle, which gives at least 1 %

 The voltage to pitch distribution curve of an oscillator is determined

 Thus octave purity is achieved.

Filter circuits are generally based upon the fact that the transfer of alternati

 frequency.
 A signal simply passed through a capacitor resembles a high pass filter.
 If the capacitor is connected to the ground the high frequencies are short
 circuited and low frequencies remain in the signal path.
 To control the charging time of the capacitor and therefore the cutoff
 frequency a resistor is added.
 This is referred to as a resistor-capacitor (RC) element.
 This simple circuit represents a passive, first-order filter with a roll-off
 of 6 dB per octave.
 To increase the slope of the filter multiple RC elements can be connected

 The envelope generator is based on the principle of slew-rate limiting.
 The rapid changes in the level of the gate voltage can be decelerated by
 again using a resistor-capacitor element.
 By using a potentiometer in the place of the resistor the charging time
 and therefore the speed of the voltage alteration can be adjusted.
 To get a typical attack-release (AR) envelope the charge and discharge
 times should be adjusted separately.
 To achieve this two preceding potentiometers with a diode each should be
 connected.
 The diodes must be pointed in opposite directions (see figure

).
 At the workshop it is possible to acquire various module kits containing
 all necessary parts and also receive tips and support while assembling
 them.

\begin_layout Standard
Due to budget limitations, it was tried to arrange a smaller setup that
 would still offer lots of sound design possibilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Formats and Interfaces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several formats for module sizes, power supply plugs or patch
 chord connectors which emerged out of the production lines of various module
 manufacturers.
 For example Doepfer's modules are only compatible with their EuroRack cases,
 with a height of 128.5mm.
 These EuroRack modules use jack connectors for patching.
 In the DIY modular synth scene it is a common practice to use banana jack
 connectors instead of mini jack for patching.
 Those have the possibility of stacking the connectors on top of each other
 and split the signal without having to use a multiplier module.
 In this project the modules are EuroRack size, but use banana plugs.

\begin_layout Section
Building
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To get started with building electronic equipment, one has to obtain some
 tools first.
 This includes a soldering iron - best with adjustable temperature, a role
 of quality soldering tin, a desoldering pump and pliers for cutting and
 bending wire.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Soldering is a process of mounting electronic parts onto a circuit board
 by heating up board and component and then melting the soldering tin into
 the joint.
 A good temperature for the soldering iron is between 300° and 350° celsius.
 The iron should not be pressed onto the joint for too long, because there
 is a risk of destroying the component if it is sensitive to heat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Power Supply and Case
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the power unit a universal power supply circuit was chosen from Robert
 Sontheimers audio circuit technology book

\end_inset

 and mounted onto a perfboard.
 Instead of the 7815 and 7915 voltage regulator ICs the 7812 and 7912 were
 used in order to get a +/-12 volt power supply with a center tap for the
 ground.
 The modules can be connected to the four male 16-pin flat ribbon connectors,
 that were added to make the power supply compliant to the EuroRack standard.
 Another possibility would be to make a flying bus board by attaching those
 connectors to a flat ribbon cable that lies in the case.
 Or even just fix female connectors to the cable and plug them directly
 into the modules.
 Additionally it is planned to add an IEC socket and a power switch for
 comfortable on and off switching and more steady starting current.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The case is a simple rack constructed from a few pieces of wood that are
 held together by 19 inch rails equipped with thread rails to fasten the
 modules.

) is printed onto a piece of high gloss paper for inkjet printers - but
 with a laser printer.
 It is cut and placed face down onto the upper side of the panel.
 By thoroughly pressing down a hot flat iron (for ironing clothes) onto
 the panel for a few minutes, the toner cartridge particles move to the
 panel.
 The paper residues need to be removed by placing the panel in some water
 and rubbing them off with a sponge.
 Afterwards the panel is sealed with transparent lacquer.
 Once the panel is dried, the holes for the knobs, switches, etc.
 can be prepunched and drilled.
 Lastly all boreholes are deburred.

This module (shown in figure

) is an extended copy of the filter from the legendary Korg MS-20 and is
 based upon the principle of the Sallen-Key filter (see chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:electronic-filter"

\end_inset

).
 It combines two linkable filter stages in one module.
 Each stage features cutoff and resonance knobs and the corresponding CV
 inputs, whereas the cutoff frequency input can be attenuated and inverted
 with one knob representing modulation depth (labeled: X-1 ...
 0 ...
 X1).
 The HP/LP switch determines, if the filter is used in high pass or low
 pass mode.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When turning resonance up, at one point the filter begins to self-resonate
 at the given cutoff frequency, which means that the filter can also be
 utilized as an oscillator.

 Therefore a volt per octave input for the cutoff control voltage was added,
 to be able to control the oscillating frequency in a musical context.

A look at the oscilloscope shows a sine like waveform.
 Turning the resonance to the maximum, the filter goes into distortion and
 the wave becomes more square causing the sound to get more rough.
 The amount of distortion is visually represented by a red LED.

 It can be used in a dual mono mode, picking up two separate output signals

 This module is still at an experimental stage.
 The idea was to use a digital microprocessor to be able to connect a keyboard
 to the synthesizer and play it via MIDI.
 To achieve this the implementation of an Arduino Uno was planned.
 Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform with a ATMega168
 microprocessor at its heart.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conveniently the Arduino must be provided with a 9-12 volt power supply,
 which made the process of connecting it to the synthesizers power supply
 easy.
 Only the appropriate plug connection had to be put together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The MIDI input communication has been established by the usage of a 6N138
 optocoupler, that isolates the Arduino circuit from the MIDI device (see
 figure 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ref{fig-arduinocircuit}
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 On the software side the Arduino MIDI Library v3.2 has been included, which
 takes care of interpreting the serial digital data arriving at the Arduino's
 RX pin.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What needs to be done next is converting the desired MIDI messages into
 control voltages.
 The gate voltage would be easy to implement, because it can be represented
 by a digital on/off state.
 The realization of the pitch control voltage presents itself as more complex,
 since the Arduino cannot output analog voltage values at its output pins
 but only digital states.
 One way would be to create a high frequency pulse width modulated signal
 and adding a low pass filter to convert it to a stationary voltage.
 This may have the disadvantage of getting a slight portamento effect though.
 The other way would be to convert the possible 128 note values of the note
 on message into seven binary values.
 These would be transmitted onto seven respective output pins.
 A digital to analog converter (DAC) would then generate the analog output
 voltage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regardless of which method is chosen, at the end the voltage should be scaled
 to conform the 1 volt per octave interface.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Summary 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper is the result of a research on the topics of history, theory
 and electronics of analog synthesis.
 Of course in all of the discussed subjects only the surfaces could be scratched.
 Even only the field of active filter circuitry can (and does) fill entire
 books.
 Accompanying this research a small synthesizer prototype has been set up,
 making use of the knowledge acquired during the research.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The objective to create a functional prototype can be considered a complete
 success.
 The synthesizer that was built is a lot of fun to experiment with, which
 was one of the initial goals also.
 Even though it is practically just a self oscillating filter, it offers
 a lot of possibilities for experimental sound design.
 Due to the fact that the banana plugs are stackable, the two output signals
 can be split several times to voltage control resonance and cutoff of each
 filter stage.
 Also various types of feedback can be generated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This project provides a great basis for further sound experimentation.
 Because of its modular setup, there is a lot of space for further modules,
 although the requirements for power supply and case size will increase
 with the number of modules.
 The next step will be the construction of an oscillator module as soon
 as time and monetary means allow it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
A Personal Journey
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a trained programmer and web application developer the field of electronic
 engineering always seemed appealing to me.
 Hence the assignment for a research paper during the audio engineering
 course at SAE Institute seemed like a welcome opportunity to dive into
 the realm of building electronic devices in the context of sound generation
 and modification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The process of writing this paper has been an unexpectedly rewarding and
 inspiring experience, pushing the boundaries of my own musical and technical
 understanding.
 Most notably the concepts of free composition - meaning allowing randomness
 and therefore putting oneself in the position of reacting to a musical
 system, influencing it in terms of tendencies, rather than controlling
 it with a predetermined mindset - has been something that really changed
 my perception of musical creativity.
 This for me seems much more attainable in the analog world, where electrical
 components and signal chains can be brought to their tipping points, resulting
 in an unpredictable outcome.
 That is where sound exploration begins, which is a totally different experience
 than knowing what will happen.
 Virtual digital environments, which I was familiar with on the other hand,
 generally seem to tend persuade the user to feel in control at all times.
